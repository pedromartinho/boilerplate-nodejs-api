## 🏗️ Initial set-up

First things first, make sure you have node installed on your machine. If you do, run the following command to set the Node version:

```
nvm use
npm i
```

Once you've done that, you're ready to get the project up and running! Here's the command you need to run:

```
npm run start
```

After that, you should have the project running http://localhost:3050 🚀
